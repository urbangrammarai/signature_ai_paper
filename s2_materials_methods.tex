\subsubsection{Chip size}
\subsubsection{Data (spatial) augmentation}

% Sliding

\subsubsection{Model architecture}

% Overall content of the section

% NN architecture: not of particular interest, hence we pick EfficientNet
% (but we show in appendix a brief comparison why)
Appendix \ref*{sec:appendixA} shows a brief comparison of several standard neural network architectures.

% We define our challenge as an image classification task and use competing
% alternatives to explore which one performs best. Each of them imply
% geographically interesting trade-off's

% Standard image classification

% Multi-output regression

% Spatial modelling of probabilities

\subsubsection{Performance metrics}

% Traditional non-spatial

% Explicitly spatial metrics
%% Why
%% Which ones
%% Why those? (ideally link to Miguel's paper suggestions)
