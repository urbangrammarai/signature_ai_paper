\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Keep it conceptual about the point of the paper

% Include literature review
% (focused on what is available at the intersection of satellite + AI)

% Highlight what the key missing bits are when AI is applied to spatial
% imagery (e.g., scale and context)

% a lot of the ai and satellite has been supervised object detection
% there is not a lot of ai for patterns rather than features - in some way it may be easier
