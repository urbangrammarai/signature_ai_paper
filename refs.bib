  abstract = {Large-scale land cover classification from satellite imagery is still a challenge due to the big volume of data to be processed, to persistent cloud-cover in cloud-prone areas as well as seasonal artefacts that affect spatial homogeneity. Sentinel-2 times series from Copernicus Earth Observation program offer a great potential for fine scale land cover mapping thanks to high spatial and temporal resolutions, with a decametric resolution and five-day repeat time. However, the selection of best available scenes, their download together with the requirements in terms of storage and computing resources pose restrictions for large-scale land cover mapping. The dataset presented in this paper corresponds to global cloud-free pixel based composite created from the Sentinel-2 data archive (Level L1C) available in Google Earth Engine for the period January 2017- December 2018. The methodology used for generating the image composite is described and the metadata associated with the 10 m resolution dataset is presented. The data with a total volume of 15 TB is stored on the Big Data platform of the Joint Research Centre. It can be downloaded per UTM grid zone, loaded into GIS clients and displayed easily thanks to pre-computed overviews.}

  abstract = {Remote sensing techniques are now commonly applied to map and monitor urban land uses to measure growth and to assist with development and planning. Recent work in this area has highlighted the use of textures and other spatial features that can be measured in very high spatial resolution imagery. Far less attention has been given to using geospatial vector data (i.e. points, lines, polygons) to map land uses. This paper presents an approach to distinguish residential settlement types (regular vs. irregular) using an existing database of settlement points locating structures. Nine data features describing the density, distance, angles, and spacing of the settlement points are calculated at multiple spatial scales. These data are analysed alone and with five common remote sensing measures on elevation, slope, vegetation, and nighttime lights in a supervised machine learning approach to classify land use areas. The method was tested in seven provinces of Afghanistan (Balkh, Helmand, Herat, Kabul, Kandahar, Kunduz, Nangarhar). Overall accuracy ranged from 78% in Kandahar to 90% in Nangarhar. This research demonstrates the potential to accurately map land uses from even the simplest representation of structures.}

  title     = {Earth observation + morphometrics: towards a systematic understanding of cities in challenging contexts},
  abstract  = {The ongoing fast and unprecedented urbanisation, strongly affecting cities in the Global South, is casting urban development into challenging dynamics, involving, for example, the construction of new or expansion of existing informal settlements lacking the most basic services. This informal urban development is insufficiently understood due to limited resources, leading to an absence of data to support its urban analysis and, consequently, obstacles to address social equity, sustainability, and resilience through urban planning and design practices. Although the potential of Earth Observation (EO) has widely been recognized for mapping different urban patterns, the surge of big data and data science, along with usually costly high resolution datasets are marginalizing the open science of interpretable urban morphology with the abstract relationship between mapped socioeconomic patterns and image features. In this work, an {"}EO + Morphometrics{"} framework is proposed to combine open EO data with open tools for explicit, reliable and consistent measurements of urban form and thus to understand development patterns based on urban morphology. More specifically, a reengineered convolutional neural network is applied to freely available Google Earth imagery to extract building footprints for entire cities. Morphometrics then uses this information to measure hundreds of metrics of the built environment and output homogenous urban form types. This two-step method is applied to a few fast-growing sub-Saharan cities. To test whether specific urban types correspond to socioeconomic patterns, we compare the outcomes with local delineations of informal settlements. Morphological types, characterised by a compact/organic urban fabric, seem to be predominantly contained in the boundaries of informal settlements. We argue that {"}EO + Morphometrics{"} paves the way for deriving a generalizable understanding of urban form in challenging contexts. This information can, in turn, be used for further analysis (for example, with socioeconomic data) and inform local planning and interventions.},
