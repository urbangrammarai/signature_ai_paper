The presented manuscript introduces spatially explicit methods built on top of
conventional deep learning for computer vision to understand the ability of open satellite
imagery (Sentinel 2) to encode form and function of primarily urban environments. It
tries to understand how landscape characteristics visible from space relates to that
derived from a wide range of data sources capturing form and function of human-made
environments.
