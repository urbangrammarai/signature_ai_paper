    \caption{\footnotesize Within-class accuracy scores grouped by signature. Each panel
    represents results from one of the 12 signatures predicted. Each column in
    the heatmap
    corresponds to one of the five models compared, namely:
    histogram-based boosted classifier (\texttt{HGBC}) with features
    pertaining only to a given chip (\texttt{baseline}) or including also features
    from neighbouring ones (\texttt{baseline-wx}); Logit ensemble
    (\texttt{logite}) with the same two variations; and a simpler maximum
    probability approach (\texttt{maxprob}). Each row
    corresponds to a pair of chipsize (8, 16, 32, and 64 pixels)
    and architechture (baseline image classification, or \texttt{bic}; sliding
            image classification, or \texttt{sic}; and multi-output
    regression, or \texttt{mor}) used in the neural network stage of the
    pipeline.}
